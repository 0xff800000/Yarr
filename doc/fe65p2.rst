FE65-P2 Operation
=====================

Scan Console
---------------------

    - Main scan execution program
    - Command line parameters:
        - "-s <scan name>": Sets the scan which should be performed, to see which scans are supported see below
        - "-p": Enable plot output (optional)
        - "-o <directory>": Specify plot output directory (optional)
    
Supported Scans
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    - *digitalscan* : Performs a digital scan, testing the digital functionality and excluding the analog pixel region
    - *analogscan* : Performs an analog scan, testing the analog pixel region by injecting a high charge
    - *totscan* : Injects a specific charge (def. 16000e) and measures the ToT response of each pixel
    - *thresholdscan* : Determines the threshold of each pixel by measuring its s-curve
    - *tune_globalthreshold* : Calibrates the global threshold DAC to the target value (def. 1500e)
    - *tune_pixelthreshold* : Calibrates the per pixel threshold DAC to the target value (def. 1500e)
    - *noisescan* : Sets the chip in run configuration and sends trigger with a high frequency (def. 1 MHz) for a certain amount of time (def. 30 s) and masks all pixels which have an occupancy higher than 10e-6 per trigger

Tuning
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    - A chip can be tuned by executing the tuning scans in a specific order, e.g.:
        - digitalscan
        - analogscan
        - tune_globalthreshold
        - tune_pixelthreshold
        - noisescan
        - thresholdscan
        - totscan

    - This order will ensure proper tuning of per pixel threshold and preamp and run two verification scans at the end
