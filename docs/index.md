YARR: Yet Another Rapid Readout
===================

What is YARR?
-------------------------

YARR is a readout system based around the concept of moving intelligence from the FPGA firmware into the host computer software. The role of the FPGA is the one of a reconfigurable I/O interface and not anymore the one of a hardware accelerator. To move the raw data into the host memory a fast bus is needed, common to all modern computers is the high-speed PCIe bus a natural interface choice. The PCIe card, the SPEC board, has been developed by the CERN beams department and is available from multiple vendors.
